# The-samuzai-smaurai
This video game is about ancient legendary Japanese warriors, samurais. They used to fight with katanaâ€™s (a Japanese sword) while they were fighting demons or legendary creatures. I tried to represent that in this game. The video game is written in Unity using C#. Which makes the games render smoothly and have null to minimum errors present within the game.
